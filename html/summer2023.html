        <p>
            While pursuing my degree in Computer Science I have developed an interest in databases and database
            management. During my Summer 2023 term, I worked as a Data Management Assistant for Kenna where I got to
            explore my interest in databases and expand my knowledge on quality assurance (QA) and software testing.
            This position combined my interest in tech with love for the outdoors because the software I worked on was
            used to help those working in agriculture.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this report, I will describe my employer and the organization, the position I worked in, what I was
            required to do, and finish off by going over my goals to outline what I accomplished in my first work
            term.
